## Research Assignment

The second half of the semester is structured as a research seminar. The goal is to write a paper that, with revisions, could be submitted to a journal for publication. Therefore, the paper should be empirical and, practically speaking, should rely on data that can be readily amassed and marshaled in the span of a semester.

To structure discussing the plans for the paper, each student was required to identify a literature to which the research is responding. Each student chose approximately 100 pages of readings that were assigned to the class one week ahead of time. The seminar meeting was then divided in two segments. First, we discussed the readings that had been assigned by the student; second, we discussed and critiqued the research design proposed by the student.

The following are the research topics chosen by the participants in the seminar that met Fall 2005, along with the reading assignments.
